IDEAS:

- figure out how to load in some houses? maybe have them on a street of sorts.
- houses will grow and shrink in size according to the percentage

- for dates, have a scroll animation
    - turn off zoom controls, keep pan controls
    - get distance from top, divide by time to get a tick for "years"
    - round to the nearest, or don't expand until the next date crosses a certain point.
        - though, would be better to just round to nearest scroll point
    - the dates can be markdown elements on top of the graphics. Have some sort of white space between
    - then, some scrolling timeline? figure out functionality regarding that.

    - figure out how to scale objects while having them stay anchored to a position on bottom (basically grow upwards)
