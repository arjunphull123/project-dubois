Hi Duo!

For reference, a rundown of git from the command line (since that's how I learned it lol):
- To clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/arjunphull123/project-dubois.git

Pull-add-commit-push cycle:
- first cd into the local repo
- Pull: git pull
- Add: git add _____.___
- Commit: git commit -m "Your message here"
- Push: git push
